                The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers). It was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969 and was first known as the ARPANET. The original aim was to create a network that would allow users of a research computer at one university to "talk to" research computers at other universities. A side benefit of ARPANet's design was that, because messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the network could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in the event of a military attack or other disaster.

                Today, the Internet is a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is used by many as the primary source of information consumption, and fueled the creation and growth of its own social ecosystem through social media and content sharing. Furthermore, e-commerce, or online shopping, has become one of the largest uses of the Internet.

<h2  >Use of Internet</h2>
<p>
    In general, the Internet can be used to communicate across large or small distances, share information from any place in the world and access information or answers to almost any question in moments.
</p>
<p>
    Some specific examples of how the Internet is used include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Social media and content sharing
    </li>
    <li>
        E-mail and other forms of communication, such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Internet telephony, instant messaging, video conferencing
    </li>
    <li>
        education and self-improvement through access to online degree programs, courses and workshops and
    </li>
    <li>
        searching for jobs -- both the employer and applicant use the Internet to post open positions, apply for jobs and recruit individuals found on social networking sites like LinkedIn.
    </li>
</ul>
